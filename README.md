# Customer Segmentation with K-Modes and K-Prototypes

This project focuses on advanced customer segmentation using **K-Modes** and **K-Prototypes** clustering algorithms. These techniques allow us to handle both categorical and numerical data to group customers based on similar attributes.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for segmentation.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and clustering.
- `src/`: Python scripts implementing the K-Modes and K-Prototypes algorithms.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command:

```bash
python src/kmodes-Customer_Segmentation.ipynb
```
## Dataset
The dataset used contains both categorical (e.g., gender, region) and numerical features (e.g., age, income).

## Clustering Algorithms
- K-Modes: Used for clustering categorical variables.
- K-Prototypes: Used for clustering mixed-type (categorical and numerical) variables.
## Results
After applying the clustering algorithms, customers are grouped into different segments based on their attributes, providing insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by creating a pull request or raising an issue.
